Hey, let's get started with handlebars templating!
=================================================

This time we are using a webserver program that we can change 
Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.


Take a look around 
-------------------

- in server.js we have info about pets (line 38) and some other things.
- in index.hbs we have the template that takes the pet data and tranforms it into HTML.

Tasks 
-------------------
- Make this the front page of your Pet Adoption website which lists all your pets
- Add a logo image
- Add 2 more pets
  - <img src="copy the url from assets or the web">
- Add the species of pet to the template
- Add a new field for colour to the server.js and to the template
- Add images of the pets to the server.js and to the template
- Add Traits to the data and then the template as a bulleted list
  - traits:["Fluffy", "Cute", â€œCalm"]
